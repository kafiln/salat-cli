**A stupid simple Command line utility to get the daily prayers time for all the citiy in Morocco**

The source of the data is [the Moroccan Ministery Website](http://www.habous.gov.ma)

## Getting started

```bash
# Install

$ npm i -g salat

# Run with default city

$ salat

# Run with custom city

$ salat [cityName]
```

`City name should be provided the same way it's written in the cities.json`

## Output

```bash
# The programs prints to the console the prayers' time for the current day in the default city as shown bellow:
```

## Dependecies

The code behind depends on :

- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) to make an http request ( fetch the data).
- [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) to parse the html result.
- [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) to avoid boring styles and colors.
- [node-localstorage](https://github.com/lmaccherone/node-localstorage) to read and write from localstorage.

## Change the default city

- The default city is :heart: [Marrakech](https://www.google.com/search?q=marrakech) :heart:, set as a value for the `DEFAULT_CITY` variable in `./constants.js`

- You can change it by replacing `Marrakech` by your city name according to the values from `./data/cities.json`
